# Applications List Generator

This repository includes an automated system for generating and maintaining an `APPLICATIONS.md` file that lists all packages in the bucket.

## How It Works

### PowerShell Script

The `bin/generate-applications-list.ps1` script:
- Scans all JSON manifest files in the `bucket/` directory
- Extracts package information (name, description, version, homepage, download URL)
- Generates a markdown table sorted alphabetically
- Tracks manifests with missing fields
- Outputs `APPLICATIONS.md` at the repository root

### GitHub Action Workflow

The `.github/workflows/update-applications-list.yml` workflow:
- Runs daily at 6:00 UTC (customizable via cron schedule)
- Can be triggered manually from the Actions tab
- Runs automatically when bucket/*.json files are modified
- Commits changes to `APPLICATIONS.md` if updated
- Creates or updates an issue for incomplete manifests
- Closes the issue when all manifests are complete

## Manual Usage

To generate the applications list manually:

```powershell
# From repository root
.\bin\generate-applications-list.ps1

# With custom paths
.\bin\generate-applications-list.ps1 -BucketPath "path/to/bucket" -OutputFile "path/to/output.md"

# Skip issue tracking
.\bin\generate-applications-list.ps1 -SkipIssueTracking
```

## GitHub Pages Setup

To publish `APPLICATIONS.md` to GitHub Pages:

1. Go to repository **Settings** > **Pages**
2. Under **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**
3. Choose branch **main** (or **master**) and folder **/ (root)**
4. Click **Save**
5. Wait a few minutes for deployment
6. Access at: `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/APPLICATIONS`

The `_config.yml` file provides Jekyll configuration for better rendering.

## Incomplete Manifests

The script identifies manifests missing required fields:
- `description`
- `homepage`
- `version` (or invalid version like ".")
- `url` (download URL)

When incomplete manifests are detected:
1. They're listed in the `APPLICATIONS.md` file
2. An issue is created/updated with label `manifest-incomplete`
3. The issue is automatically closed when all manifests are fixed

## Reuse in Other Buckets

This system is designed to be generic and reusable:

1. Copy files to your bucket repository:
   - `bin/generate-applications-list.ps1`
   - `.github/workflows/update-applications-list.yml`
   - `_config.yml` (optional, for GitHub Pages)

2. No modifications needed! The script automatically:
   - Detects the bucket directory
   - Handles different manifest structures
   - Works with any Scoop bucket

3. Customize if desired:
   - Modify cron schedule in workflow
   - Adjust issue labels or messages
   - Change output format in PowerShell script
